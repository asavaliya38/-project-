# ITMO 540 Final Project Questions

## Background and Instructions

The purpose of this project is to see how a computer in a network gets internet access and is able to route between networks. We need to envision and understand the process packets take to communicate across the network. Ultimately the goal here is to describe the complete process to retrieve a sample webpage. We will be using snippets of real packet captures. You will be asked a series of questions and provided with information about the network and will have to fill in the values or explain basic concepts. We will assume that your computer is on a wired Ethernet connection for these questions and refer to the provided network diagram and the Readme.md file for network information.

There are 71 questions and or fill in the blanks (XXXs) to complete in this document. Each question or fill in the blank is worth 1 point.

### Retrieving an IP Address

You have just turned on your computer at the University. This is computer A in the ITM Network of the provided diagram. Your computer will use the DHCP protocol to try to retrieve an IP address for Computer A. Looking at the packet capture for the first step of the DHCP process (shown in packet capture below) and answer the following questions:

<pre>
Internet Protocol Version 4
    0100 .... = Version: 4
    .... 0101 = Header Length: 20 bytes (5)
    Differentiated Services Field: 0x00 (DSCP: CS0, ECN: Not-ECT)

    Flags: 0x00
    ...0 0000 0000 0000 = Fragment Offset: 0
    Time to Live: 128
    Protocol: UDP (17)
    Header Checksum: 0x0000 [validation disabled]
    Source Address: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    Destination Address: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
</pre>

1. What is the first phase of the DHCP process?  
i. Discover
1. What would be the source IP in the Network layer of this packet?  
i. Source IP: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
1. Explain your previous answer.  
i. The source IP address is the address of the computer (Computer A in this case) that is sending the DHCP Discover packet.
1. What is the destination IP address in the Network Layer of this packet?  
i. Destination IP: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
1. Explain your previous answer.  
i. The destination IP address is the address of the DHCP server that will receive and process the DHCP Discover packet.

### Link Layer Communication

Once you have retrieved an IP address via the DHCP process, now you can communicate with computers on the network. Let us try to connect Computer A and Computer B over the network to see if Computer B is on the network and responding to network traffic. Answer the following questions and fill in the replace the XXXs with the values requested (2 in all).

<pre>

    Target IP address: 192.168.1.10
</pre>

### HTTP Traffic

Assume Computer B has an HTTP server. From Computer A assume you open a web browser and make a request to http://192.168.1.11. Answer the following questions and fill in the XXXs with the proper values (3 in all).

<pre>
Internet Protocol Version 4
    0100 .... = Version: 4

1. Briefly explain the concept of Sequence Numbers and Acknowledgement numbers is TCP.  
i. Sequence numbers are used to track the order of sent data, and acknowledgement numbers acknowledge the receipt of data.
1. What is the default port that HTTP listens on?

1. What transport layer protocol is this request using?  
i.  TCP
1. What is the name for the first three TCP packets that are exchanged before an HTTP connection is made.  
i. Three-way handshake

Now we will take a look at the HTTP protocol content to discover what our request is trying to accomplish. Using this WireShark capture of the HTTP connection between Computer A and Computer B:

<pre>
Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
      Request Method: GET
      Request URI: /
      Request Version: HTTP/1.1
    Host: 192.168.1.11\r\n
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:107.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/107.0\r\n
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\r\n
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\r\n
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n
    Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\n
    Pragma: no-cache\r\n
    Cache-Control: no-cache\r\n
</pre>

1. List the HTTP version  
i. HTTP/1.1
1. List the HTTP method  
i. GET
1. List the Request URI  
i.  /

Answer the following questions based on the response to this HTTP request:

<pre>
Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
        Response Version: HTTP/1.1
        Status Code: 200
        Response Phrase: OK
    Date: Sun, 27 Nov 2022 03:23:20 GMT\r\n
    Server: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.4.30 mod_perl/2.0.11 Perl/v5.16.3\r\n
    Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Mar 2016 18:57:50 GMT\r\n
    ETag: "a5b-52d015789ee9e"\r\n
    Accept-Ranges: bytes\r\n
    Content-Length: 2651\r\n
    Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100\r\n
    Connection: Keep-Alive\r\n
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n
</pre>

1. What is the Status Code and what does this mean in regards to the request?  
i. Status Code: 200 (OK), indicates a successful request.

### Understanding Routing of Packets

Based on the three networks detailed - create a forwarding table that includes prefix and output port by updating the table below - use the information from the Readme.md file for reference. Add your values to the chart below.

| Network Prefix | Output Port |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| - | - |
| - | - |
| - | - |
| *otherwise* | 3 |

On the Netflix Router complete the forwarding table

| Network Prefix | Output Port |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| - | - |
| *otherwise* | 3 |

If you make an HTTP request from Computer A in the ITM Network to Computer A in the Netflix Network, http://netflix.com:

1. Which Output Port Interface will your packet be forwarded to on the School Network Router?  
i. Output Port Interface: 1
1. For the TCP packet returning the ACK from Computer A in the Netflix Network to Computer A, which Output Port Interface will your packet be forwarded to on the School Router?  
i. Output Port Interface: 3
1. A HTTP request is sent from Computer A in the ITM network, for the IP address of 192.168.5.5. When this packet hits the router - explain what will happen?  
i. The router will drop the packet and may send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.

1. When a packet reaches the router and the TTL is at 0, explain what will the router do with that packet.  
i. The router will drop the packet and may send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.
1. Software Defined Networking can route based on fields in three layers, list these three layers and the 11 fields possible.  
i. Layers: Network Layer, Transport Layer, Application Layer
Fields: Source IP, Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port, Protocol, ICMP Type, ICMP Code, DNS Query, DNS Response, HTTP Method, HTTP URI

1. Briefly explain the difference between a switch and a router (assume the classical model).  
i. A switch operates at the data link layer and forwards frames based on MAC addresses, while a router operates at the network layer and forwards packets based on IP addresses.
1. Briefly explain the concept of a subnet.  
i. A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network, created by dividing an IP address space into smaller, more manageable segments.
